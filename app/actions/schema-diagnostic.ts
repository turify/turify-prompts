// Make sure all instances of executeQuery are using the correct import
// If there are any imports like:
// import { executeSql } from "@/lib/db"
// Change them to include executeQuery:
// import { executeSql, executeQuery } from "@/lib/db"

// Or if there are imports like:
// import { executeQuery } from "@/lib/db"
// Keep them as is, since we've now added the executeQuery function back
